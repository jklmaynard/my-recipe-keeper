SOME STEPS TO WORK ON

1. Create recipe page for individual recipes. 
   --> from here, add a list of ingredients (this has to be a recipe.ingredients().each() method which means a post into the join table.)

2. Add a categories post method on the recipe page. 
   --> follows another join table post.
